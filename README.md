# tax-calculator assignment

**This assignment may be completed using JavaScript or Python.**

Points wants to build an income tax calculator to help illustrate how marginal taxes work.

As the project lead, your job is to create a
[single page web application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
that lets users submit their annual gross income to see how much they would owe in federal income tax.

This assignment may be completed using JavaScript or Python.
For Python, please implement a command line interface instead of the web interface described below.

## Notes

* Use [Canadian federal income tax rates](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/frequently-asked-questions-individuals/canadian-income-tax-rates-individuals-current-previous-years.html#federal) for 2019.
* The web application should include two screens:
  * The first screen should display a form, which includes an input field and a submit button.
    * The input field should accept the user's gross salary.
    * Submitting the form should navigate to the second screen.
  * The second screen should display a breakdown of tax rates and amounts for each applicable tax bracket,
  as well as the total tax amount and effective tax rate.
    * It should be possible to navigate back to the first screen.
