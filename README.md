## Setup Instructions

This application was developed using Node version 12.8.0. If you need to install Node, it is suggested that you do so with [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to allow you to have multiple versions of Node installed at once.

This project supports NVM, and you can run `nvm use` in this repo to match your local Node version to the project's.

To install and start the project:

- Install the dependencies by running `npm install`
- Start the application on a local development server with `npm start`
- Unit tests can be run with `npm test`
